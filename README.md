# Profit-Leakage-Detector-Global-Sales-Analytics
This project uncovers silent margin erosion across global product, region, and customer segments — helping organizations detect Profit Leakage that’s often hidden beneath top-line growth.

In many enterprises, revenue may look healthy, but profits quietly suffer due to pricing gaps, unbalanced customer tiers, or low-margin product-region combinations. This solution integrates SQL, Python, and Power BI to identify those risks and support leadership with action-focused financial intelligence.

  The Business Problem
Enterprises often experience:

Strong revenue growth masking margin loss

High-selling products generating below-average profits

Customers who contribute volume but dilute profit

Regional inconsistencies in product profitability

This silent profit leakage impacts overall financial health, distorts forecasting, and leads to poor pricing or customer strategy decisions.

 Solution Overview
This project combines structured datasets, SQL queries, Python logic, and executive dashboards to:

✔ Detect risky segments with:

High revenue but low profit margin

Below-average profit customers and industries

Product–region combinations with underperformance

✔ Analyze and quantify:

Segment-wise revenue vs margin gaps

Customers contributing to profit dilution

Hidden financial inefficiencies across business dimensions

✔ Deliver:

Risk-flag tables for strategic action

Revenue vs margin league rankings

Executive BI dashboards to guide performance reviews
